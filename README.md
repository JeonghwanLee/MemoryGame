# Memory Game Project

This game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Why did I this project?

This memory game presents the opportunity to fully combine skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** into a large project. Aside from solidifying my skills with these three technologies, I'll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.
